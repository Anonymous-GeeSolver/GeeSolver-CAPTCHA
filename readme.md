# GEESOLVER

This reposity is official implementation of "GEESOLVER: A Generic, Efficient, and Effortless Solver with Self-Supervised Learning for Breaking Text Captchas".

## Usage of text captchas

Text captchas have good user-friendliness, so many companies (e.g., Google, Microsoft) still use them on user login pages. After entering incorrect passwords multiple times, the user will be required to submit the results of text-based captchas. Detailed use cases are available on https://github.com/Anonymous-GeeSolver/GeeSolver-CAPTCHA/tree/main/Cases (collected on Oct. 2022). The complete Alexa list and the corresponding captcha schemes are available on https://github.com/Anonymous-GeeSolver/GeeSolver-CAPTCHA/tree/main/AlexaList.
